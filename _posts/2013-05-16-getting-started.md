This is your Jeykll powered site. This base site, is a boilerplate that you can use to
start your own project.

You can add styles to this base site by editing the style file located in `css/style.css` and editing
`index.html` and, or, `_layouts/default.html`. On the other hand, this post is stored in the `_posts` <br/> folder and is written in [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/).
